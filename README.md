# Introduction 

The game of Cops and Robber is a pursuit evasion graph searching game that was first introduced in 1978. The game is played on graphs with a set of cops trying to catch a robber controlled by the opposing player. Over the years, a lot of variations have been introduced and studied, however, we focus on the damage variation and introduce a new paramater called the "Damage Number of a Graph". In this version, the robber inflicts damage on every distinct vertex they visit. We can think of scenarios where our network is vulnerable or expensive, in which case the cop actually stays back to contain or minimize the damage rather than trying to capture the robber. This variation can be extended to multiple cops and robbers, however, we only consider one cop and one robber.  In 2019, Cox and Sanaei proved that in a random graph, with extreme probabilty, the cop can save at least half of the vertices. Equivalently, graphs where the robber can damage near to or half of the vertices are extremely rare. Few examples of such graphs are Wagner graph and Pappus graph. We conjecture that for the entire class of Mobius Ladder Graphs, denoted M_{2k} where k can be even or odd, the robber can damage near to half of the vertices when k is odd i.e dmg(M_{2k})=k-1 and exactly half of the vertices when k is even i.e dmg(M_{2k})=k.
